**CS39-AF genAI SPA Project One**


**Project Overview and Purpose**

This project was developed completely by generative AI, specifically Claude and ChatGPT. 
This project serves as a drawing studio that allows a user to draw on a canvas. The
drawing studio allows users to doodle if they are bored or need something to do while they 
have a few spare minutes. It also serves as a whiteboard that users can use directly on their device. 
The purpose of this project was to experience how to use AI as a software developer to build a 
single-page web application. 

**Features and Functionality**

Drawing Studio functions like a whiteboard or a blank canvas. It allows users to draw on a blank canvas
and bring their ideas to life. Whether you want to draw a portrait or write down important information, 
drawing studio is right there for you. Drawing Studio allows you to use a brush to paint on the canvas. 
It allows you to choose different colors and change the size of the brush. Don't want to paint with a brush.
Choose between lines, rectangles, or shapes to bring your ideas to life or to add extra objects to your
canvas. You can also choose to change the color and the size of the lines, rectangles, and shapes. Did you
make a mistake? Use the eraser to delete lines or use the clear button to completely clear the canvas. 
The select tool allows you to move, duplicate, or delete a selected area. If you want to save your drawing,
simply click the download button and save it as a PNG file. 

**Known Issues or Limitations**

While Drawing Studio has many functions and features, it also has its errors. The eraser has a bug in which it starts
to draw black lines over the canvas while it attempts to erase the objects. The eraser does not erase, rather it paints
white over the canvas. The move on the select tool is offset and will make the selected area disappear if it goes off the screen. 
The duplicate tool duplicates an object right there, but does not let move it again without selecting the area.
The download button only downloads the canvas in PNG files and does not have a background, rather it is transparent. 

**Future Enhancement Ideas**

In the future, I would like Drawing Studio to include more features and functions. I would start by first fixing the
eraser and the select tool. I would ensure that both the move and the duplicate tool are able to show the user a preview and
be able to move or duplicate a selected object. I would also include more tools to draw and write with including pens, crayons, 
colored pencils, and a text box. I would also allow users to save a drawing and see their past drawings all on the browser.
I would also like it to work with touch screens, so it can be accessible on multiple devices. I would also include a dropdown menu, 
so that users can select different shapes and lines.
